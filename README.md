# VeriClaim
VERICLAIM: AI-Powered Insurance Claim Eligibility Checker VeriClaim is a robust, full-stack application designed to instantly assess insurance claim eligibility and potential fraud risk. It streamlines the initial review process by combining advanced Machine Learning (ML), vector embeddings, and policy matching, providing clear, data-backed decisions in real-time.  This project demonstrates a fully integrated architecture using a Python FastAPI backend and a custom-designed React frontend.  üåü Key Features Real-Time Eligibility Decision: Provides immediate APPROVED, DENIED, or REQUIRES REVIEW statuses based on integrated analysis.  Semantic Policy Matching: Utilizes sentence embeddings and a vector store to compare the user's natural language claim query against policy clauses extracted from documents (e.g., PDFs).  Anomaly/Fraud Detection: Features a trained Isolation Forest model that flags claims exhibiting statistical anomalies based on structured data (claim amount, patient age, claim history).  Transparent Reasoning: Every decision is accompanied by detailed reasoning, including the most relevant policy clause, the calculated semantic similarity score, and the fraud risk assessment.  Modern Frontend Design: Built with React, featuring a clean, dark-themed UI that dynamically visualizes complex analysis results for easy review by claims adjusters.  üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack Component  Technology  Role  Frontend  React (JavaScript)  User interface, form data capture, and visual results presentation.  Backend/API  FastAPI (Python)  High-performance, low-latency API handling data routing and orchestration.  Machine Learning  Scikit-learn, Joblib  Isolation Forest for fraud detection (trained via Jupyter).  Policy Analysis  Sentence Transformers, Vector Store (In-Memory/Pinecone)  Converting and querying policy text and claims for semantic similarity.  üöÄ Getting Started Follow these steps to set up and run the entire system locally.  Prerequisites Python 3.8+ (with venv activated)  Node.js and npm  Running the Application Start the Backend (Terminal 1 - API):  # Activate your virtual environment first python -m uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --port 8000  Load Models and Policy Data (Terminal 2 - Setup): This trains the fraud model (using CSV data) and uploads policy clauses (from the PDF) to the vector store.  python load_data.py  Start the Frontend (Terminal 3 - UI):  cd frontend npx react-scripts start  The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
